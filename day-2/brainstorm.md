# Day 2

## Part 1

### Clues

**Opponent:**

- A for Rock,
- B for Paper,
- C for Scissors,

**Me:**

- X for Rock (scores 1),
- Y for Paper (scores 2),
- Z for Scissors (scores 3),

The total score of each round equals the score of the shape plus the score
for the outcome of the round (0 if I lost, 3 if it's a draw and 6 if I win).

### Scenarios table
