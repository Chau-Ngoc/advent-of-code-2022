# Advent of Code 2022 Challenge

## What is Advent of Code
Advent of Code is a series of challenges for programmers where each day of
December you are provided a new puzzle to solve using any programming language 
you like. Each year, the challenges are presented on the theme of different 
topics. This year's topic is to help the elves find enough stars to feed the 
Christmas reindeer before December 25th.
